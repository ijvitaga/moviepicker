Intro

Choice is a powerful human right. Choosing simple things like - What should I do today? What do I want to eat? What clothes or shoes should I wear to this event? - can range from easy to very difficult. I have created an website to help lessen the load with one of those questions - What movie should I watch? "Movie Picker" is a great way to choose a movie when you can't decide on what to watch. 


Technologies Used

I used the API from the website themoviedb.org. It is innovative enough to be able to grab data from searching a movie genre instead of a movie title.

I also used youtube to add a compilation of movie clips just as a background to the website to add asthetics.

Approach

I wanted to be solve a problem some people have when choosing what movie to watch. I used the API from themoviedb.org to filter movies by genre.

I also wanted to build a website that wasn't dull. I wanted to make the homepage entertaining by adding a background video loop with scenes from movies.

By adding a carousel to the wepbage, my goal was to make the process of choosing a movie more interactice than just choosing from a list.

Instructions

Search any genre of movies by typing it in the input box. The carousel will bring back a list of movies in that genre with some details about the movie.

Adversity

The background video was difficult to implement without the buttons and to have it loop and autoplay. I had to put a clear picture over the dimensions of the video to stop any user from pausing the background video. Making the video loop was challenging as the code was tricky and I had to read a lot of documentation to fix what should have been very easy to do - loop the video. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

Using the API
At first it was hard to target data from the API.
